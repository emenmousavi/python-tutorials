# List Comprehension: Efficiently manipulate lists while saving storage on the server

# Example: Converting temperatures by dividing them by 10

temps = [221, 331, 141, 122]

# 1. **Basic List Comprehension**
# This method creates a new list by dividing each element in the original list by 10
new_temps = [temp / 10 for temp in temps]
print(new_temps)  # Output: [22.1, 33.1, 14.1, 12.2]

# **Note**: The result contains floating-point numbers, but we can save storage by avoiding floats.

# 2. **List Comprehension with Conditional Filtering (if statement)**

# This example filters out a specific value (141) before performing the division operation
new_temps = [temp / 10 for temp in temps if temp != 141]
print(new_temps)  # Output: [22.1, 33.1, 12.2]
# 141 is removed from the result as it does not meet the condition (temp != 141)

# 3. **List Comprehension with if-else Statement**

# In this case, if the value equals 141, it will be replaced by 0 instead of being divided
new_temps = [temp / 10 if temp != 141 else 0 for temp in temps]
print(new_temps)  # Output: [22.1, 33.1, 0, 12.2]
# 141 is replaced by 0 in the resulting list, while the others are divided by 10
